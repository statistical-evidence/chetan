## What Drive Us

The cornerstone of our progress in scientific frontiers is systematic research. Through it, we are able to advance our knowledge and expertise like never before. The advancements in computing technologies and a tremendous increase in the amount of data have placed a huge responsibility on statistical sciences to be transparent and accurate. Now, it has a crucial role in the development of 'good scientific practices' for the larger benefit of society.  

Statistics act as a powerful tool for describing, summarising, and deriving inferences from the data. But at the same time, in the wrong hands, it can be misused for publishing misleading research with deceptive headlines and inaccurate methodologies, wrong evaluations, and poor-quality reporting. Based on these unreliable and faulty research findings, many businesses, organisations, and government agencies make decisions that lead to detrimental effects on society and damages people's trust in scientific research.  

> “We need to focus on less yet better scientific research, which should be performed for the right reasons.”


These are the words of Doug Altman, a recognised statistician of Oxford University. They were published in 1994 in the Editorial of ‘The Scandal of Poor Medical Research.' This publication later made to the top of the most important papers’ list of 'The British Medical Journal' from the last 20 years.
Dr Chetan Prajapati founded ISCON Statistics. He laid its foundation on two core principles of ethical statistical practice:

- Quality in statistical methodology application
- Quality in research reporting 

At ISCON Statistics, we ardently follow both these principles to deliver precise and quality results. Our expertise in statistical and scientific methodology enables us to perform comprehensive, in-depth, and accurate statistical analysis of the provided data. In turn, this helps you achieve high-quality and reproducible research results, enabling you to make logical and informed decisions.
